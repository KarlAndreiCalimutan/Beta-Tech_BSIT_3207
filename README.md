# Project Title: Data Based Outlook to Reduce Flood Damage to Property an Exploratory Data analysis on Flood Damage To Property



**Introduction**

Flooding is a natural worldwide disaster in both industrialized and low-middle income nations, accounting for roughly 40% of all environmental disasters. Flooding has a significant impact on human health before, during, even after the flood. Southeast Asia is fantastically prone to common and extreme environmental disasters. The most recent floods in Southeast Asia were caused by a combination of events, including typhoons, heavy rainfall, and tropical storms. Four tropical cyclones, in addition to robust and prolonged monsoon rains, induced huge harm in Thailand, Cambodia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia. On a big scale, those extraordinary monsoon rains, typhoons, and tropical storms are the final results of weather alternate, a complicated gadget marked through dynamic relationships among land, our bodies of water, and inhabitants.   Southeast Asia is vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change due to its rapidly rising population, the majority of whom are destitute, insufficient food security, and diminishing natural resources.  Narrow mitigation efforts have been attempted by institutions throughout Southeast Asia. These initiatives, however, are often unsustainable because of a loss of network connection and engagement. As a result, it induced extraordinary and big harm throughout Southeast Asia areas livelihood and economy. The goal of this study is to create an exploratory data analysis of floods from the 12 months 2001-2020 in an effort to calculate the entire damages to each country recorded with inside the statistics sets. Furthermore, it will likely be ranked up from every country primarily based totally at the numbers of floods recorded and it'll display the distinction among the maximum damaged countries primarily based totally on the entire harm to the least damaged countries. These statistics will display particular and intact records of statistics which could assist and save you the harm resulting from flood to each united states in Southeast Asia.



**Problem Statement**

Floods are natural disasters that can cause casualties and property damage. As a flood-prone region, Southeast Asia (SEA) is regularly hit by floods, causing the highest death toll in the world. Despite the devastating effects of flooding, how flooding has changed over the past few decades and the magnitude of its damage on the SEA is unclear. Using the data, we gather; we aim to assess the trend of flood damages to properties in the SEA in 2001–2020.

Since low flood control standards in SEA are considered a cause of high flood-induced mortality, priority should be given to establishing higher flood control standards to mitigate potential flood damage. This work gives scientific insights for better flood risk management by estimating the occurrence and impact of floods.



**Significance of the Proposed Project**


This data analysis research will provide fresh light on the country's reaction to and mitigation of the consequences of typhoons. The following proponents will benefit from this research :

- Government - This research will help them in taking immediate action prior to a disaster to reduce losses in the event of a flood. The planning process, as well as suggestions from existing frameworks in the United States, will aid them in establishing how to build, create, and develop the community while developing risk-reduction cooperation.
- Community -This study teaches the community about the solutions and approaches that might be used to secure their safety during a floods.
- Students - Students will benefit immediately from this study since the findings may encourage them to look into data analytics as a tool to help their community establish effective disaster prevention and response plans, particularly during flood. They will also be informed about how to protect themselves and their family from flooding.
- Parents - This research may inspire parents to consider programs that incorporate learning to help students cope with the destructive effects of flood.
- Future Researchers -This study contains flood mitigation and response frameworks in order to minimize flood damage. As a result, the findings of this research might be used to guide future discussions and analyses of effective frameworks used by governments throughout the world that the SEA governments could adopt for its own system.
- 
**Methods**

This study mainly aims to produce an exploratory data analysis regarding flood damage caused to the countries in South-East Asia, with that knowledge the proponents want to produce a compelling analysis on the dataset used that will push the countries to see what other countries that has significantly lower flood damage inflicted that they don’t have.  A collaboration where participating countries will share their knowledge in creating a more flood resilient country in the future.




**Expected Output**

This research aims to bring about an exploratory data analysis of floods from the year 2001 to 2020 from the countries within the South Eastern region of Asia that resulted in the highest damage to property as well as their respective local governments that experienced the least amount of damage to property. The worldwide flood datasets derived from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters will be used to rank the number of property damages in each country from worst to least, and then to determine which location in South Eastern Asia had the best flood mitigation strategies. This information will be used to create a flood mitigation strategy that will help SEA countries most affected by floods save as much as possible. By collaborating with other countries in developing new strategies, next time floods arrived not much would be carried away.

**Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Project**

The SDGs that this project aims to achieve are Sustainable Cities and Communities and Climate Action. These SDGs are further described as follows;
![Untitled design (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103100002/170150818-d411ddcc-0060-4620-8d67-b37230fc5581.png)
1.	**Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** - This SDG aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. 
									
3.	**Goal 13: Climate Action** - This goal strives to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

These SDGs are in line with the Proposal Topic: Data Based Outlook to Reduce Flood to Property Damage EDA: Flood Damage to Property Reduction as it will provide a mitigation and quick response plan based from multiple frameworks from different countries within the South Eastern region of Asia that are tried and tested. These frameworks will help the governments of the countries that are take more damage caused by flood by assimilating the said frameworks from other countries and applying it to their own allowing them to mitigate damage to property caused by floods.

# Project Title: Data Based Outlook to Reduce Flood Damage to Property 



**Introduction**

Flooding is a natural worldwide disaster in both industrialized and low-middle income nations, accounting for roughly 40% of all environmental disasters. Flooding has a significant impact on human health before, during, even after the flood. Southeast Asia is fantastically prone to common and extreme environmental disasters. The most recent floods in Southeast Asia were caused by a combination of events, including typhoons, heavy rainfall, and tropical storms. Four tropical cyclones, in addition to robust and prolonged monsoon rains, induced huge harm in Thailand, Cambodia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia. On a big scale, those extraordinary monsoon rains, typhoons, and tropical storms are the final results of weather alternate, a complicated gadget marked through dynamic relationships among land, our bodies of water, and inhabitants.   Southeast Asia is vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change due to its rapidly rising population, the majority of whom are destitute, insufficient food security, and diminishing natural resources.  Narrow mitigation efforts have been attempted by institutions throughout Southeast Asia. These initiatives, however, are often unsustainable because of a loss of network connection and engagement. As a result, it induced extraordinary and big harm throughout Southeast Asia areas livelihood and economy. The goal of this study is to create an exploratory data analysis of floods from the 12 months 2001-2020 in an effort to calculate the entire damages to each country recorded with inside the statistics sets. Furthermore, it will likely be ranked up from every country primarily based totally at the numbers of floods recorded and it'll display the distinction among the maximum damaged countires primarily based totally on the entire harm to the least damaged countries. These statistics will display particular and intact records of statistics which could assist and save you the harm resulting from flood to each united states in Southeast Asia.



**Problem Statement**

Floods are natural disasters that can cause casualties and property damage. As a flood-prone region, Southeast Asia (SEA) is regularly hit by floods, causing the highest death toll in the world. Despite the devastating effects of flooding, how flooding has changed over the past few decades and the magnitude of its damage on the SEA is unclear. Using the data, we gather; we aim to assess the trend of flood damages to properties in the SEA in 2001–2020.

Since low flood control standards in SEA are considered a cause of high flood-induced mortality, priority should be given to establishing higher flood control standards to mitigate potential flood damage. This work gives scientific insights for better flood risk management by estimating the occurrence and impact of floods.



**Significance of the Proposed Project**


This data analysis research will provide fresh light on the country's reaction to and mitigation of the consequences of typhoons. This research will specifically benefit the following:

- Government - This research will aid them in taking immediate action, prior to a disaster, to mitigate losses in the case of a typhoon disaster. The planning process and suggested ideas from established frameworks in the United States will assist them in determining how to plan, create, and develop the community while fostering risk-reduction collaborations.
- Community - This research educates the community about the solutions and methods that might be implemented to ensure their safety during typhoon catastrophes and floods.
- Students - Students would immediately benefit from this research since its findings may motivate them to investigate data analytics as a way to assist the community in which they live in developing efficient disaster mitigation and response plans, particularly for typhoons. They will also be informed of their precautions to safeguard themselves and their loved ones against storms and floods.
- Parents - This research may persuade parents to pursue programs that include instruction to assist pupils in coping with the damaging impacts of typhoons.
- Future Researchers -This paper discusses mitigation and response frameworks to minimize the devastation caused by typhoons. Thus, the findings of this study may be utilized to inform future conversations and analysis of effective frameworks employed by governments throughout the world that the Philippine government could adopt for its own system.


**Methods**

This study mainly aims to produce an exploratory data analysis regarding flood damage caused to the countries in South-East Asia, with that knowledge the proponents want to produce a compelling analysis on the dataset used that will push the countries to see what other countries that has significantly lower flood damage inflicted that they don’t have.  A collaboration where participating countries will share their knowledge in creating a more flood resilient country in the future.




**Expected Output**

This research aims to bring about an exploratory data analysis of floods from the year 2001 to 2020 from the countries within the South Eastern region of Asia that resulted in the highest damage to property as well as their respective local governments that experienced the least amount of damage to property. The worldwide flood datasets derived from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters' Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) will be used to rank up the number of damages to property to each country from the highest to lowest and then determine what location in the South Eastern Asia had the best countermeasures for flood damage. This data will be utilized to be able to develop a flood countermeasure strategy that can potentially help the countries most affected by floods be more capable of saving as much as they can. By collaborating with other countries in developing new strategies, next time floods arrived not much would be carried away.

**Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Project**

The SDGs that this project aims to achieve are Sustainable Cities and Communities and Climate Action. These SDGs are further described as follows;
![Untitled design (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103100002/170150818-d411ddcc-0060-4620-8d67-b37230fc5581.png)
1.	**Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** - This SDG aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. 
									
3.	**Goal 13: Climate Action** - This goal strives to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

These SDGs are in line with the Proposal Topic: Data Based Outlook to Reduce Flood to Property Damage EDA: Flood Damage to Property Reduction as it will provide a mitigation and quick response plan based from multiple frameworks from different countries within the South Eastern region of Asia that are tried and tested. These frameworks will help the governments of the countries that are take more damage caused by flood by assimilating the said frameworks from other countries and applying it to their own allowing them to mitigate damage to property caused by floods.
